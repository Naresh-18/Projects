# Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction
This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on various features related to the concrete mix. We’ll walk through the steps involved in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and hyperparameter tuning.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is concrete_data.csv. It contains the following features:

Cement
Blast Furnace Slag
Fly Ash
Water
Superplasticizer
Coarse Aggregate
Fine Aggregate
Age
The target variable is the Concrete Compressive Strength.

Preprocessing Steps
Loading Data: Load the dataset using pandas.
Checking for Missing Values: Verify if there are any missing values using df.isna().sum().
Checking for Duplicates: Identify and count duplicate rows using df.duplicated().sum().
Removing Duplicates: Remove duplicate rows with df.drop_duplicates().
Resetting Index: Reset the index after removing duplicates with df.reset_index(drop=True).
Outlier Capping: Apply the IQR method to cap outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Histogram Plots: Visualize the distribution of each feature.
Box Plots: Identify outliers in the dataset.
Correlation Matrix: Understand the correlation between features.
Modeling
We used the following regression models for prediction:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Random Forest Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression
Hyperparameter Tuning
We performed hyperparameter tuning for the Gradient Boosting Regressor using GridSearchCV. The parameter grid used:

Python

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200],
    'learning_rate': [0.1, 0.01],
    'max_depth': [5, 3, 7],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 4],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 3]
}

Results
Model performances were evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score. The results were printed and compared for different preprocessing techniques:

StandardScaler
MinMaxScaler
RobustScaler
Conclusion
The Gradient Boosting Regressor with hyperparameter tuning provided the best results. This project demonstrates effective preprocessing, EDA, modeling, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve accurate predictions for concrete compressive strength.
